**Project Title:** Go Daddy Platform with Integrated Payment Gateway
**Project Overview**
This project demonstrates the development of a minimalistic e-commerce platform that integrates a payment gateway (e.g., PayPal, Stripe, or Razorpay). The goal is to showcase your skills in building and deploying a full-stack application while effectively implementing a secure payment flow.

Features
Frontend (User Interface):

Product listing with images, descriptions, and prices.
Cart functionality (add/remove products, view cart total).
Checkout form for user details (name, email, address).
Backend (Server and API):

RESTful API for managing products, users, and orders.
Integration with a payment gateway for secure transactions.
Webhook to handle payment status updates.
Database:

Product details storage.
User and order information storage.
Payment transaction records.
Authentication:

User registration and login functionality.
Basic session or token-based authentication.
Deployment:

Hosted on platforms like AWS, Heroku, or Vercel.
Secured with HTTPS.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js.
Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
Payment Gateway: PayPal SDK or Stripe API.
Deployment: Dockerized application hosted on AWS/GCP/Heroku.
Implementation Steps
Frontend Development:

Set up React.js application.
Create pages for product listing, cart, and checkout.
Implement a responsive UI with Tailwind CSS.
Backend Development:

Build a Node.js API using Express.js.
Set up routes for products, users, and orders.
Integrate PayPal SDK for payment processing.
Handle payment confirmation using webhooks.
Database Integration:

Connect the backend to the database using an ORM (Mongoose/Sequelize).
Payment Gateway Integration:

Generate and confirm payment transactions using the chosen SDK/API.
Redirect users to the payment gateway for processing.
Handle payment success, failure, and cancellations.
Testing:

Write unit tests for API endpoints.
Test payment flows using sandbox environments provided by the payment gateway.
Deployment:

Dockerize the application for consistent environments.
Deploy the frontend and backend using a cloud service.
Set up environment variables for sensitive data (API keys, database credentials).
